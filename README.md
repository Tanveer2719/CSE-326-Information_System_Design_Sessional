This is a repository for the course CSE-326 A sessional of CSE-325(https://cse.buet.ac.bd/undergrad/coursedetail.php?courseid=CSE325)
In this course, we have designed a Project "BookExchange: Connecting University Student By Books"
The main idea of our project is to share the books owned by the students of various Universities of Bangladesh. The students can
buy, sell or borrow books via our website. They can also share their reviews about the book and the chapters taught in their course
from this book. 
The repository contains:
1. The Scope presentation of our project
2. BPMN diagram of the project
3. MockUI of the project using figma
